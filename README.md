This repo holds random treasure hunts I did for my family over a couple of christmases.

They are generally stupid but fun to do, especially as one year I was doing DNS on christmas morning like some sort of demented scrooge.

In 2023 and 2024 these were hosted at www.themostannoyingpresentgamepresentever.shop but I am not sure I will keep those domains, so it might not work if you're reading this in the future

Each year we play a present game, which is where everyone buys cheap presents and we roll dice to see who gets what without knowing what is inside. At some point, you get the option to steal. I decided to secretly hide a treasure hunt in the presents that eventually pointed to [this page](/2023.html), which revealed that there was money slipped underneath the label of a tin of beans.

We found an old briefcase and put some goodies inside, but didn't tell anyone else the code. I created three QR codes with query params that pointed to [this page](/index.html), each of which unlocked one number and saved it in localstorage, so if someone was lucky enough to get all three they'd have all three, but if more than one person got a number they'd have to share.
