This repo holds random treasure hunts I did for my family over a couple of christmases.

They are generally stupid but fun to do, especially as one year I was doing DNS on christmas morning like some sort of demented scrooge.

In 2023 and 2024 these were hosted at www.themostannoyingpresentgamepresentever.shop but I am not sure I will keep those domains, so it might not work if you're reading this in the future
